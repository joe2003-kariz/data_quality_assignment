# Data Quality and Time-Series Analysis Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related materials for a project on data quality, big data storage formats, and time-series analysis using ECB exchange rate data.

## Project Structure

- `ecb_scraper.ipynb`: Notebook for downloading and preprocessing ECB exchange rate data.
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Notebook for cleaning and normalizing time-series data.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and time-series transformation.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-quality-assignment.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages (if not already available):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib requests
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in order.
